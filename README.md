# Celtic Adventure
## Overview
## Development
### Technology
#### Unity
#### Ummorpg
I'm using the uMMORPG 2d plugin to create the mvp of this game.
### Questions
1. How can you share gold/experience/items across their account? Lvl 7 account would mean all characters are that level.
1. How can you equip a pet like a sword so you dont have to summon? Users can unquip (no pet) or equip a different one. Different pets offer different bonuses, etc.
1. Auto pick-up gold?
1. How can I display 1 monster name per cluster? (instead of everyone having the name above them or none)
1. In multiplayer, how can you have item drops be per player(only visible to that player)
